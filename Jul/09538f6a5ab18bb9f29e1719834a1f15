Cabinet met on the 21 July 2010 to consider the recommended sanctions that would be applicable to Members of Cabinet for breaching the Executive Members Ethics Act 82 of 1998. This follows the Public Protector s report that found that President Zuma did not comply with the requirements of disclosure of interests as required by the Executive Members Code of Ethics. Cabinet adopted the following sanctions as an interim measure against a member who breaches the Code: a) a fine not exceeding the value of 30 days salary; b) a reduction of salary or allowances for a period not exceeding 15 days. These sanctions will be applicable to members of the Executive until the Minister of Justice completes a review of the Executive Ethics Code. The meeting noted that the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development was finalising a comprehensive report that would address all the issues and gaps that were identified by the Public Protector. This report is expected to reach Cabinet no later than November 2010. Enquiries Themba Maseko Cell: 083 645 0810 Issued by Government Communications (GCIS)top
